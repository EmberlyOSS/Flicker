# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep Flicker and Emberly secure. This document explains how to report security issues and how we handle reports.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Preferred: Submit a private security report via GitHub Security Advisories for this repository: https://github.com/EmberlyOSS/Flicker/security/advisories
- Alternatively, you may email security@embrly.ca for confidential reports.
- For non-sensitive discussion or triage, you may also contact us on Discord: https://embrly.ca/discord
- Do NOT post vulnerabilities publicly (issues, PRs, or social media).

When reporting, include:
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (minimal repro if possible)
- Affected versions or commit hashes
- Any PoC code or screenshots
- Your contact email for follow-up (if not using GitHub Advisories)

We will acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for remediation.

## Scope

This policy covers the `uploader` (Flicker) desktop application and its associated backend endpoints and APIs managed in this repository.

## Supported Versions

Please indicate the app version and platform in your report. We prioritize currently supported releases and actively maintained branches.

## What We Will (and Won't) Do

- We will investigate and, where appropriate, fix confirmed vulnerabilities.
- We will coordinate disclosure with the reporter and, if required, publish a disclosure after a fix is available.
- We will not issue bounties as a rule, but may make exceptions at our discretion.

## Disclosure Process

1. Reporter emails `security@embrly.ca` with details.
2. We acknowledge within 48 hours.
3. We triage and assign severity and responsible engineers.
4. We coordinate a fix and a disclosure timeline with the reporter.
5. Once fixed, we publish an advisory (if applicable) and credit the reporter unless they request anonymity.

## Safe Harbor

We ask researchers to follow responsible disclosure: do not exploit or exfiltrate user data while testing. We will not pursue legal action against good-faith security researchers who follow this policy.

If you have questions about this policy, open an issue on the Flicker repo or email security@embrly.ca.
